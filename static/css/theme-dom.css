/*

Inspired from theme-pista.css and from

https://tools.pingdom.com/ (referred as site-b)

we will have a yellow banner with green primary buttons and black-and-white secondary buttons similar to site-b

please create a styleshet on the same.

also look into the button heights for normal buttons and large buttons.

the input heights should match.

the top nav header should blend in with the hero section similar to the site-b

the black color is so good on the texts. we will keep the current font-family and see to changing it later if required.

make a nice footer styling also. you can see some accent / hover text colors with grey in site-b
